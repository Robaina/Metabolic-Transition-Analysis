# Metabolic-Transition-Analysis
This repository contains the MATLAB code of an optimization method to compute metabolic trajectories.
This method relies on metabolic network constraints alone. Hence, it does not include any functional form
to describe the dynamics of metabolites. Instead, it allows to investigate how the network alone affects
metabolite dynamics. It also allows to include several optimality criteria and constraints, such as initial,
interior and final boundary conditions. It also allows to sample the space of alternative optimal trajectories
that satisfied the specified constraints.
